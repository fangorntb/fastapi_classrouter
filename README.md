# Fastapi Classrouter
---
Solves the problem of not quite convenient documentation of fastapi code (takes documentation from docstring, + creates a response model based on class parameters), partially avoids duplication of HTTP resources, can determine the availability of http methods out of the box based on their names, can work with placeholders.
